# FAQ-Accordion_Card
A simple and responsive accordion built with HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JS

The accordion has hover animations as well as click animations that allow you to see the answers to the FAQ's. 

I learned a ton with this project, as this is my first taste of a truly professioanl looking dynamic webpage.

KNOWN BUGS:

Need to figure out how to only be able to select one FAQ at a time instead of being able to activate multiple at once. The accordion works like it's supposed to but only allowing one FAQ to be active at a time would help make it look more professional. It would also really help me be able to have the questions stretch the entire main box's height.

I probably struggled with responsiveness the most on this project. I used DevTools to make sure it looked good on mobile S, mobile M, mobile L, tablet, laptop, laptop L, and 4K, but screens that don't fit all of those exact dimensions may encounter bugs in the deisgn and layout of the accordion.
